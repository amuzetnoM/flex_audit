# Fix: EXEC_USAGE

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** Security
**Occurrences:** 2

## Description

Use of exec() can lead to arbitrary code execution

## Affected Files

- `src\constants.py:156`
- `src\report_generator.py:515`

## Suggested Fix


```python
# Instead of:
exec(dynamic_code)

# Use structured approaches:
# 1. Configuration-based logic
# 2. Plugin systems with sandboxing
# 3. Domain-specific interpreters
```
