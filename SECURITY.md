# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please don't open a public issue.
Instead, follow these steps:

1. Email the maintainers at `security@artifactvirtual.example` with full details.
2. Provide a reproducible PoC, minimal reproduction steps, and suggested mitigation advice.

We will respond within 72 hours and coordinate a fix or mitigation.
